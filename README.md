# Just Dev It - my portfolio page
Page created with React and node.js. Uses Graphql and Apollo queries, authentication with passport.js and passport-google-oauth-2-0.
Two type of Routes : public and admin. Both uses different HTML5 UP templates separated by using less.
To make it work you need to add .env file with three entries:
 - mongoURI, 
 - GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
 - GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET

You also need to initialize yarn in root and client folder to make it work and configure google credentials.
Sorry for not making commits, but initially I planned only to deploy it on heroku.
